Person Class:
	int ID
	string name
	string level
	overload all comparison operators to compare ID
		need Person to Person (for insert) and int to Person (for search) comparison

	string major
	double GPA

Faculty Class:
	subclass of Person
	string dept

Trees:
	should do normal tree stuff

File I/O functions:
	check for file
	create empty trees
	import trees
	save trees

Database Functions:
	all the stuff from the assignment sheet
	can probably do most of these as functions that take pointers to trees as arguments
	need to be careful when deleting people to update stuff correctly
	need to update the rollback stack when needed
	when creating people, need to make sure their ID is unique
		idea: when placing in tree, if already taken generate a new id and try again

Rollback Stack:
	need a stack that can hold last five versions of the tree
	probably want to delete the bottom of the stack when it exceeds size 5 to avoid clogging up memory
